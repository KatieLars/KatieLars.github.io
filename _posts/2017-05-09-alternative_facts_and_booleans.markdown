I hate booleans. They make me feel I'm chasing my tail with their simplicity.

Or trying to put a round peg in a square hole.

I burned through the boolean and conditional lessons like nobody's business, and the quiz didn't prove that hard for me either. But when I got to creating the #position_taken? method, my code broke, my momentum broke and my frustration grew. True and false--easy enough, right?

It was that very simplicity that burned when those test didn't pass. How could I get #position_taken? to give me a false response? It seemed so easy in the quizzes. . . then I realized, I was only being asked the outcomes of boolean statements rather than generating actual code designed to give me a desired response. On top of that, said desired response was false. And boy, does my brain want that desired response to be true. . . It was like asking *for* an "alternative fact"  instead of the truth. And the frustration was blowing my mind.

So I'm putting booleans on ice for the moment, and letting the desire for falsity sink in during the night. Maybe I'll listen to the dulcet shrieking of President Trump to truly channel that cannily creative impulse for untruths.

Or not.
