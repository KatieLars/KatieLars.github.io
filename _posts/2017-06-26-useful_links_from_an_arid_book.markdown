Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites.

I finished what was simultaneously the driest but most useful book I may have ever read: Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites. That I had a tough time getting through it was was actually a surprise to me, as I generally enjoyed the HTML and CSS section of the Flatiron curriculum. After the more conceptual section on GitHub, front-end code seemed concrete--you could actually see the immediate results of what you were doing. Suddenly, from art to wine to a reading club, ideas for websites abounded in my head. Because you know, if you build it, they will come.

But like I said, Duckett's work was useful. In retrospect, I think I wouldn't read it cover-to-cover like I did, but use it as a reference. It has a ton of tips and a nice troubleshooting guide in the back with solutions for fixing some of the most common HTML/CSS problems. Attractively laid out, it exposed me to older elements of HTML code (this book was written when the transition to HTML 5 wasn't quite complete), basic design theory, SEO and keywords, and integrating Flash into HTML. Now granted it wasn't quite as up-to-speed as Flatiron's HTML & CSS lessons (there was nothing mentioned about .clearfix, for instance, although Duckett did reference it), but it does provide a group of handy-dandy websites for use when designing and implementing a website. What follows is an abbreviated list of those links that seemed most promising for getting a website up and, you know, read by someone other than your mom. Note: I haven't tried all these guys out, but when I do, I'll be sure to update

**BBedit**: a HTML and text editor for Mac OSX users that looks like it has some wonderful tools for text control

**Pixlr**: an online photo editor with free fonts and graphics, as well as a mobile version

**iPiccy**: another online photo editor that has an easy-to-use interface for collages and basic graphic design

**Blueprint**: CSS framework that reminds me of the Twitter one we used in the code-alongs. I love that the Department of Commerce uses it.

**960 Grid Systems**: I'm old school and I love that I can actually print out the grid system to physically sketch on. All the templates and grids are based on the 960px width of a browser window and are available in 16 column or 12 column format.

**Keyword Discovery**: SEO stuff. Look up a keyword and find related ones people are looking for. Google has a similar product with Adwords, but this one seems to be free (I think at some point Adwords makes you pay to appear higher up in search listings).
