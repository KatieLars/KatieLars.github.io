My presence here is . . . unusual. At least for people who are not me. I just got off an exhausting 10-year project working to become a museum curator and a crushing 2-year stint in wine retail. For the majority of the folks I know (including my very own folks), coding came out of left field. I remember my mom saying "Medical coding?" when I told her what I wanted to do.

If you're me, though, my presence here is not at all unusual. Here's a caveat before I continue: Now I am extremely lucky. I have a warm home, food, can pay my bills, and have a wonderful support system. I'm also a white, educated female living in a safe area of a large American city. I am heterosexual and have a gender identity that corresponds to my sex. I come from a middle class background and have lived abroad. I have health insurance and am healthy. I am priveleged in the extreme. This is not the inspiring story of how I overcame all the odds and became a role model. This is a recounting of frustrations with systems and modes of thought I found limiting (and if I found them limiting, I cannot imagine what they would be like for others who are less privileged than me). And, I assure you, it is how I came to code.

After I started work on my dissertation--which was about 3 years ago--, I ran into a sort of reality wall. Maybe it was my getting older and more practical, maybe it was the end of the degree in sight, but there it was, looming large and ugly. Dusty, monochrome bricks--some of which were crumbling--made up its career possibilities; its mortar was poverty, debt, and want. At the top, there were a few shiny pinnacles--genuine gold--buttressed by the harsh slab underneath. But perhaps strangest of all was the shadow it cast on my idealism and my unwavering faith in the value of art and its history. That shadow and the realities of academia and its place in the world seemed to suck the air out of anything that was not them--i.e. it seemed to suck the air out of the subjects academica studies. Out of art history itself. 

But I was passionate about writing, about art, about learning. Surely I would overcome this and get what I needed. And if I didn't, the fault would be mine. I wasn't passionate enough. Millions of others had followed the same path and come out on top. Yet the grants were few, the advice was strange ("Power through your dissertation!" "But how am I supposed to eat?") and disconnected from reality, and at the end of it all, many of the job processes are convoluted. To be a professor, you sometimes had to pay for your job application in the form of hotels, flights, food, and time. And frequently the initial interview is conducted in a hotel room. WTF? Nevermind, PASSION!

When I moved to Chicago, I was then offered jobs in the arts that had no pay. That's right: they interviewed me and said I could work for them . . . for free! With the idea that the "experience" or "connections" would eventually land me somewhere with a pay check. So I sold jeans for pay, and made a website (SquareSpace--I can't code yet;) for free. The connections or benefits from experience never came. Oh well. Because . . . PASSION. 

Over the years, I saw friends graduate and move to odd places for jobs; stay home and have babies; work and give up on wanted children; or make $10,000/year and sleep on sofas. And I realized that it wasn't me. It wasn't about how much passion I had for the subject. Academia--the sociocultural monolith formed by men over the past 200 years that composed the practical realities of my subject--was out of touch, and abusively so. 

To say that the world is moving faster than ever before is an understatement. And here was this unyielding, calcified system that took advantage of students (uh, I was paid 13,000/year to teach 2 classes, but was taxed for 43,000/ year because of tuition. I basically paid taxes with loan money) and professors alike. Because of PASSION.

And at the end of the day, I can't say that I actually accomplished anything that seemed to have an impact on either me or my field. I can't point to any monetary impact I had on sales or efficiency; I can't point to how many people I trained or projects I lead; I can't point to any results for anything. Sure, I've taught several college-level art classes, have extensively cataloged Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, have published articles in 2 edited volumes, and spoken at several conferences. Most of these accomplishments, however, are not translatable outside academia.

Exhasperated, but still holding on to finishing that degree, I took a job at a wine retail store. I love wine. It's simultaneously the most wonderful thing I've ever put in my mouth and the grossest thing I've ever put in mouth (yes, it beats out the time I accidentally swallowed a fly or got bits of a wool sweater between my teeth--I didn't expect those things to be delicious; I expect wine to taste good, so when it doesn't, the disgust is laced with disappointment, which makes it infinitely worse than flies or wool). 

While this experience was crushing for me on many levels (my first overt experience of sexism, no chance for advancement, insufficient wages, weird work duties, strange promotion practices etc.), it was great on many others (wine, co-workers, wine). And I saw the wall in wine too. It just looked different: the bricks were multicolored, some dusty, some slick; the mortar was low wages (no debt this time) and uncomfortable choices. But there were a lot more pinnacles at the top (burgundy-colored of course), and the wall was significantly shorter. Passion could actually get you there. 

What struck me most about the wine, though, was how everyone seemed to come at it from another field: insurance adjustment, music, furniture retail, office admin, journalism, stock brokerage, commercial editor, etc. Nearly every person I met had come to wine because they loved drinking it, learning about it, and teaching others about it. You may not have started with the passion, but boy, did you sure feel it. 

No one in art history was like that. Everyone started with a passion for art. In fact, when I first enrolled in my MA, I felt woefully out of place because I didn't know David from Gericault or who the Ashcan artists were. I was an English and French lit major in undergraduate studies. Your decision was a concrete, logical continuation of your passion. And I do mean concrete in the architectural material sense. 

But the retail was killing me, the hopelessness of ever advancing or earning enough to pay off my loans.

Then I got lucky: my boyfriend got a lucrative job. I instantly quit at the wine shop. I was going to be an art historian again. . .
Then the tuition bill came due. $7,000 for 4 months. No professors (I was dissertating), no actual courses. Basically, $7,000 to access the library and call myself a student. I guess I could've accessed the gym had I still lived in the same city as my university. I paid the bill. Then I quit.

And a load was taken off me. I physically felt lighter. My attitude and health improved. Surprisingly, I didn't regret what I did. I was only concerned with whether or not my parents were let down, but they were behind me. I didn't know what I wanted in the positive yet, but I did know that I didn't want to work at the wine store or be in academics. 

Here's where the coding comes in. Now I had dabbled in code at Codeacademy and had looked at the idea of making an art history app about a year earlier to my enrollment at Flatiron. It was appealing, the idea of actually building something in the world that people could use. But I had always thought of it as something I could do after I got the PhD. A sort of sideline. After all, that was not how things were done for art historians. The entry requirement was the PhD. You had to get it. Digital humanities would come after.

By the time December had rolled around and the decisions had been made. I was unemployed and, to outsiders, aimless. It felt (and still feels) as if any time spent outside of employment or education is necessarily wasted. America is all about doing and producing. What are you doing right now? What are you working on? You will be able to produce, right? Those are frequently the deciders of individual worth or value, which is why being a stay-at-home parent or elderly person is, I think, a tough position. Kids get a pass. They aren't ready to produce yet, but eventually they will. 

Life is bigger than this, though. And as much as that homogenizing narrative of productivity/value attempts to corral humans and shape our ways of thinking, it will never succeed. There are too many paths. Too many options. Some we will choose, and some will choose us. Most importantly, there are too many people for any one way to prove correct or satisfactory.

It suddenly dawned on me that I could do whatever the hell I wanted. Human beings have the unprecedented ability to destroy and change this planet. They have for quite some time now. That we can do anything as a species is simultaneousy the most terrifying *and* liberating thought. But we have to take the risk of believing that that we *can* change if anything *is* going to change in the way we want it to. And it is a risk to believe that. It may mean that at times you are working outside of conventional systems, outside of the narrative of productivity/value. It may mean alienating your friends and family, completely or to a degree. It may mean the painful confrontation of privelege and feelings of powerlessness.

So contrary to what the productivity/value narrative was tellling me (that I was doing nothing and currently had no value), I *was* doing and I *did* have value. I began writing again. I redid our porch. I got my finances in order. I did apply for jobs, but only those that I really wanted. I had interviews. I reached out to friends. I got a therapist. And I planned.

When I started reaching out to people in November and December, I came across an old friend of mine whose career had recently changed. Kate Travers and I both attended grad school together, and I knew she had worked for many years in the art shipping industry. So needless to say, when I saw her Facebook place of employment as "Flatiron School" I was interested. Was this a new art school? Was she teaching? What the what?

When I found out what it was, I remembered my brief Codeacademy interest, and I began clicking around the Flatiron website. I talked to Kate (whose encouragement was amazing and very much needed). I checked out the US Bureau of Labor for the job outlook on web developers. I had ideas for both wine and art in tech. And I began the bootcamp.

What was more important, though, was the relief and comraderie that seemed to occupy every step of the journey. Here were people I could ask for help. Sometimes they were experts, and sometimes they were learners like me. But it was a team effort to help each other. There really isn't that sort of set up in art history or wine. Wine tasting groups can be cliquish, and my experiences with art historians were either peer-reviewed stuff that took 4 years to get through or informal problems of wording or editing. But in code, you could reach out to folks, and THEY WOULD RESPOND! Amazing!

And the failing! I loved the failing. You're tests didn't pass. AND NOTHING HAPPENED. It was great. If I were to fail something in art history (which was getting a B), it would be tramautic. There would be tears. You'd have to go see the Director of Graduate Studies. You'd have to go see your advisor. You'd basically have to question whether or not you had the passion or the commitment or the chops to continue. In wine, if you failed your somm test, you'd be out about $1600 and have to repay to take it. Not that big of a deal, but when you make less that $15/hour, it can be a huge setback.

But what sold me on coding was the endless hope for change. This is a skill to change the world. Coding, like any language, changes the way you think, how you think, what thoughts you're even capable of thinking. If academia was brutally slow to change, and wine was the refuge for the passionate, coding thrived off of change and welcomed all passions. I still love art, and I still love wine, but it's time for my relationship with them to change (particularly art). And I hope to change others' relationships with art and wine as well.

Coding is the realization that humans are capable of anything. We can change this world. We can breathe new life and value into that which we thought was ashen and defunct. We can create knowledge and build structures for expanding access to it. And we can do it together, one coding puzzle at a time. 

And that is why I code. 

Boy, do I sound like an Obama '08 campaign ad.
